Theorem (NegatedNonReflecivity)
  Suppose
    ¬(c ∈⁺ c)
  Then
    ¬(c ∈ c)
  Proof
    (c ∈⁺ c) 𝘪𝘧𝘧 ((c ∈ c) ∨ ((c ∈ d) ∧ (d ∈⁺ c))) by TransitiveMembership
    ¬(c ∈⁺ c) 𝘪𝘧𝘧 ¬((c ∈ c) ∨ ((c ∈ d) ∧ (d ∈⁺ c))) by BiconditionalContrapositive
    ¬(c ∈⁺ c)
    ¬((c ∈ c) ∨ ((c ∈ d) ∧ (d ∈⁺ c))) by BiconditionalImplicationLeftElimination
    ¬(c ∈ c) ∧ ¬((c ∈ d) ∧ (d ∈⁺ c)) by NegatedDisjunctionInfersConjuctionOfNegations
  Therefore
    ¬(c ∈ c) by ConjunctionRightElimination

Theorem (UnquantifiedNonReflexivity)
  Suppose
    c ∉⁺ c
  Then
    c ∉ c
  Proof
    (c ∉⁺ c) 𝘪𝘧𝘧 ¬(c ∈⁺ c) by TransitiveNonMembership
    c ∉⁺ c
    ¬(c ∈⁺ c) by BiconditionalImplicationLeftElimination
    ¬(c ∈ c) by NegatedNonReflecivity
    c ∉ c 𝘪𝘧𝘧 ¬(c ∈ c) by NegatedMembership
    ¬(c ∈ c)
  Therefore
    c ∉ c by BiconditionalImplicationRightElimination
