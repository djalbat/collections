Variable x:Element
Variable C:Collection

Theorem (NegatedMembership)
  x ∉ C iff ¬(x ∈ C)
  Proof
    ¬(x is an element of C) iff x ∉ C by NonMembership
    x is an element of C iff x ∈ C by Membership
    ¬(x is an element of C) iff ¬(x ∈ C) by BiconditionalContrapositive
  Therefore
    x ∉ C iff ¬(x ∈ C) by TransitiveBiconditional
